                    Networking will be a big part of my project as I can't have hardwire connections from my laptop to a flying Huzzah. Today I'll try to setup WAN connections with my ESP32 via a firebase server. While a LAN connection is more than enough for me, I feel more comfortable with firebase, which allows me to easily establish a database and website. On the other hand, I would have to code everything on the Arduino IDE for a LAN only connection.
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I started off by following the tutorials. A few problems arose due to mismatched versions of firebase, but I easily fixed them. The real issue was GitHub pages. For some unknown reasons, Github couldn't load my code onto my website.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "github_error.png" alt = "Github error" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>Github Error</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    After a good two hours of struggling, Github finally seemed to fix itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I went on Firebase's <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database"> reference page</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP32/blob/master/src/README.md">esp32 firebase library</a> to learn how to send and request informations between an esp32, a database, and a website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two functions I found particularly useful were <code>set()</code> and <code>update()</code>, which both allow me to make realtime changes to the database. The former completely replaces the preexisting data in a specified node, while the latter only changes one of its values. 
                </p>

                <h2>Planning</h2>
                <p>
                    A drew up a plan for the networking side of my final project.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "network_structure.png" alt = "Network Structure" style="width:100%">

                <p>
                    I don't have the IMU and the Altimeter ready at the moment since I need to solder them at my friend's place. So for now, I will just build the database for the thermistor and the servo.
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>ESP32 Feather</h2>
                <p>
                    I started off by hooking up the thermistor and the servo, and writing code to transmit their data to the database. I used the following code to build the database structure.
                </p>
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
void setup() {
    //…
    //…
    //...
// Set initial data to 0. Not sure if some of these will be in "double", I'll fix this once I start testing the sensors
Firebase.setDouble(firebaseData, root + "Sensors/Temperature/Data", 0);
Firebase.setDouble(firebaseData, root + "Sensors/Humidity/Data", 0);
Firebase.setDouble(firebaseData, root + "Sensors/Altitute/Data", 0);
Firebase.setDouble(firebaseData, root + "Sensors/Velocity/Data", 0);
Firebase.setDouble(firebaseData, root + "Sensors/Orientation/Data", 0);

Firebase.setInt(firebaseData, root + "Motors/Servo/Data", 0); // set initial Servo angle to 0. (from 0 to 180)
//…
    //…
    //...
}
</code></pre>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "database_structure.png" alt = "database structure" style="width:40%">
                    <figcaption>Database Structure</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    I added other sensor values that I won't be able to use yet, but it's good to plan ahead and write them in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I converted my thermistor code from <a href="../07_ElectronicInput/index.html">day 7</a> into a function and called it within the main loop.
                </p>

                <h2>Thermistor Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    I quickly ran into problems with my <code class="language-arduino">analogRead()</code> when I started testing. After fooling around for half an hour, I found this very helpful <a href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/102">GitHub thread</a>. Basically, all the ADC#2 pins on the esp32 are being used while Wifi is enabled. This meant that my analogRead pins were limited to A2, A3, A4, A7, and A9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I quickly switched pins, and it worked!
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l1xxsB6fQgS42cyyTa" style="position:relative; width:100%" height=400rem frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, this pin reads in data slightly differently from the one I used for the calibration, pin 13. When I turn off the Wifi and use pin 13, it is always accurate. As a result of this difference in reading signals between these pins, my temperature reading is now 4 degrees off.
                </p>

                <h2>Servo Motor</h2>
                <p>
                    I copied and pasted servo code from <a href="../04_RapidPrototyping/index.html#improve_steering">day 4</a>. This turned out to be smooth sailing, and now the Servo motor responds when I change the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see my esp32 networking code <a href="./esp32_network.ino" download>here</a>.

                <h2>Web Interface</h2>
                <p>
                    I finished linking my esp32 to my database, but now I need a webpage to act as an interface for the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to add a textfield that let's me change the servo's angle, and I want to display the thermistor's temperature as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve the first goal, I threw together some javaScript and an html form.
                </p>
<pre><code>
&ltbody&gt
    ...
    ...
    ...
&ltform&gt
    &ltlabel for="vol"&gtServo Angle (between 0 and 180):&lt/label&gt
    &ltinput type="range" id="angle" name="angle" min="0" max="180" onchange="updateServo()"&gt
&lt/form&gt
    ...
    ...
    ...
&lt/body&gt

&ltscript&gt
    ...
    ...
    ...
function updateServo(){
    var angle = document.getElementById('angle').value * 1.0;
    console.log("Current Angle" + angle);
    ref.update({
        "Motors/Servo/Data": angle
    });
}
    ...
    ...
    ...

                <h2>Temperature reading</h2>
                <p>
                    This required me to read data from the database using javaScript. It wasn't too difficult after I learned about the <code>on()</code> function in the firebase library. It lets me take a <code>DataSnapshot</code> of my database when a sepecified <code>event</code> occurs.
                </p>
<pre><code>
var tempRef = firebase.database().ref("/Sensors/Temperature/Data")
tempRef.on('value', function(tempDataSnapshot) {
    var temp = tempDataSnapshot.val();
    document.getElementById("tempDisplay").innerHTML = temp;
});

                <h2 id="api">Weather API</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to display weather data on my website since knowing the weather will make flying the hot air balloon easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did some digging online and found the endpoint for Boston's weather: <a href="https://api.weather.gov/stations/KBOS/observations/latest">https://api.weather.gov/stations/KBOS/observations/latest</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't quite sure how to request data from APIs using javaScript. After learning about various methods from this <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/all-possible-ways-of-making-an-api-call-in-plain-javascript-c0dee3c11b8b">very helpful article</a>, I landed on Axios. It provided me with a very easy way to pull data from an API, and it also automatically parses the JSON response into a javaScript object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is the function I wrote for the API request.
                </p>
<pre><code>
function getWeather() {
    axios.get('https://api.weather.gov/stations/KBOS/observations/latest')
        .then((response) => {
            document.getElementByID("time").innerHTML = "Time: " +  response.data.properties.timestamp;
            document.getElementByID("temp").innerHTML = "Outside Temperature (Celsius): " +  response.data.properties.temperature.value;
            document.getElementByID("wind").innerHTML = "Wind Direction (degree): " +  response.data.properties.windDirection.value + ", Wind Speed (km/h): " +  response.data.properties.windSpeed.value;;
            document.getElementByID("humid").innerHTML = "Humidity (percent): " +  response.data.properties.relativeHumidity.value;
    });
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the values sent in by the API will be null. I double checked that it wasn't my fault by going to the endpoint myself. Sadly, I can't stop the National Weather Service from changing their database, so I can't do anything about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I now have the underlying logic of the website, I still need to make it a lot more visually appealing. It would be nice to be able to control the Servo motor with a virtual knob. On top of that, I'll need to incorporate more sensors as I start soldering them.
