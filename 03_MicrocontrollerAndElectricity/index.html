        <h2>Reading Analog Input</h2>

                    I used a potentiometer for this assignment. A potentiometer is a voltage divider, and it allows me to set a variable resistance by turning its knob. When I connected it to the analog pin "A0", the pin sent serial communications to my computer, and I was able to read the voltage on my computer's serial monitor.

                    I used a code demo called "AnalogReadSerial" to program the Arduino. The name is very self explanatory, it reads an Analog signal and puts it up on a Serial monitor. The comments on the demo are very descriptive as well.

                <h2>Motor Circuit</h2>

                <p>
    				After building the potentiometer circuit, I adapted it for a DC Motor. A DC Motor directly converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, and is very simple to use. It has a positive and negative side, and it will run as long as there is a powerful enough current going through it.

                <p>
    				I measured the voltage going through the potentiometer using a Multimeter. At the setting with the <b>least</b> resistance, the voltage actually showed to be <b>4.97v</b>. I infer that this is because the potentiometer does not truly have a 0Ω setting, but rather the lowest setting is simply very close to 0Ω.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				After this, in an attempt to practice using Ohm's law, I turned the potentiometer knob to the middle. The voltage was <b>7.81mV = 0.00781V</b>. I then turned off the Arduino in order to measure the resistance of the potentiometer at that setting, and it was <b>64.2Ω</b>. According to Ohm's law, <b> I = ΔV/R </b>, so <b>I = 0.00781V/64.2Ω = 0.00012A = 0.12mA</b>. Using Ohm's law, I figured out that this motor circuit with this particular potentiometer setting has a current of <b>0.12mA</b>.
