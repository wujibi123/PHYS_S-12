                    I wanted to automate my curtains for this assignment. I want my curtains to open at set times in the morning and let the sunlight wake me up naturally. 
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    The plan is very simple, my curtain has two strings which opens/closes it. I'll attach a motor to each one, spinning in opposite directions. This will let me pull on one string while letting go of the other.
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>Stepper Motors</h2>
                <p>
                    Stepper motors are perfect for this application since it will repeatedly turn the same amount of rotations. I hooked up two motors to my metro, following my <a href="../08_ElectronicOutput/index.html"> own documentation</a>. I used a 9v power supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I uploaded the sample code with slight modifications to accommodate two motors, and they ran as expected. 
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>Attaching to the Curtain</h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I wrapped a string around the motor shaft and tied the string's other end to my curtain.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "string_motor.png" alt = "string_motor" style="width:100%">
                    <figcaption>String Attached to Motor</figcaption>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    With the strings attached, I tested the directions of the motors and found that positive for motor one and negative for motor two worked well.
                </p>

                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p>
                    I needed to install the motors below the curtain in a permanent way. I did this by turning a card game box into a case, which I then hot glued to the ground. The case for my motors had two holes in the back to allow for wires to pass through, and it also had two openings at the top for the strings. I also hot glued the motors to the casing to ensure that they wouldn't move around.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code I used is very similar to the one provided to us during class. Here it is:
                </p>  
<pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include &ltStepper.h&gt

const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;  //200 for our steppers.

    step_count += step_dir;               //modify accumulated steps accordingStepper1.step(-step_dir);

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    Now I can finally get to testing. I needed to figure out how many steps it takes to fully open my curtain. However, things went awry during the very first test.
                </p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>
                    I smelt smoke coming from the machine, and immediately afterwards, one of my stepper motors suddenly stopped turning. After that, it kept spasming and doing random rotations.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Motor Malfunction</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    I restarted the metro a bunch of times and even switched the motor drivers, but to no avail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came back the next day to solve the problem. I noticed that the Atmel chip on the metro was always burning hot. Furthermore, the metro stopped receiving uploads altogether. The board would just turn off whenever I tried to upload my code. I was too frustrated to continue, and I decided to wait and get help during Monday's lab session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After talking with Nathan and Victoria, I switched my microcontroller to an Arduino Uno, which is the only spare microcontroller I had. At first, nothing happened, but after replacing the motor driver with a new ones, the stepper motor finally turned! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the problem was a combination of the metro board and a fried motor driver. It took so long to figure it out since I kept fixing one or the other, not both issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I got back to testing and found that 3000 steps is enough to fully open the curtains!

                <h2>Malfunctions</h2>
                <p>
                    My happiness didn't last long. Soon after that video was taken, my other motor driver burnt out as well. This time I had no replacements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the string I attached to the motor was too thick, and it kept skipping steps.
                </p>

                <h2>Future Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to get new supplies and improve this machine before the due date. However, I will definitely improve this and share the results later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first improvement will be using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BIQU-A4988-StepStick-disipador-controlador/dp/B01FFGAKK8/ref=sr_1_31?dchild=1&keywords=motor+driver&qid=1595891336&sr=8-31">A4988 motor driver</a>, which should be less susceptible to burnouts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I will use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SINGER-260-Invisible-Thread-135-Yard/dp/B000IGEBSS/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=nylon+string&qid=1595909018&sr=8-5">nylon threads</a> as my string. These will be thinner than my current ones, and so they will skip steps less frequently.
                </p>

                <!-- New Section -->
                <h2>Future Code</h2>
                <p>
                    After these improvements are implemented, I will be able to perform recurring actions. I can then use the following code to open and close the curtains at specific times. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I utilized the <code class="language-arduino">Time</code> library. My reasonings are in the comments.
