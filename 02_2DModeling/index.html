                    I first created a folder where I would store all my components. Each component is in its own separate file. Then I measured the dimensions of each component with a caliiper, storing them as parameters. Here is a screenshot of my parameters for my bearing:

                    <img src = "parameters.png" alt = "parameters" style="width:50%">
                    <figcaption>Note: No KERF since these designs won't be laser printed</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    After I measured my parameters, I sketched the basic geometry of each component and extruded them into 3D. I used <b>threading</b> for the nut and screw, and I used <b>joints</b> for the bearing (including <b>decal</b> for aesthetics)

                        <li>After seeing the nonfunctional details of the bearings, I realized that I don't need to measure additional details that won't affect the application of the product.</li>
                        <li>Parameters allow your design to be fluid and forgiving.</li>
                        <li>The backside of the caliper can be used to measure the insides of components. I used this to measure the inner diameters of the bearing and the nut.</li>
                        <li>During assembly, different components can be combined easily using : "move" â†’ "point to point".</li>

                        <li>Threading can be done on any cylindrical surface.</li>
                        <li>The "modeled" option forces the computer to render the threads more clearly. However, It could become computationally heavy when modeling multiple screws.</li>
                        <li>I need to create a small offset (0.01 mm) for the threads so that the nut's opening remains a circle.</li>
                        <li>I need to measure the pitch of the threads.</li>

                        <li>The "Joint" option moves the components so that they connect together.</li>
                        <li>By selecting two components, I can then choose the way in which they move together.</li>
                        <li>I chose "revolute", which makes the two parts of my joint spin together.</li>
                        <li>After the joint is created, I could freely spin one part of it by grounding the other component.</li>

                        <li>I used decal to put two "stickers" of my dog, Annie, onto the bearing so that I can clearly see its spinning motion.</li>
                        <li>I had to switch to "rendering", and then choose the "decal" option. Once there, I was able to put any image I wanted onto a face that I chose.</li>
