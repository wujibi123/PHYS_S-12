                    Hi, my name is Dan. I am a rising Junior at BB&N, which is a school in Cambridge, MA. I'm very excited to be taking this course. My interest in Digital Fabrication began when I founded the Arduino club with my friend, and hopefully this class will allow me to pursue some of the ideas that we couldn't bring to life last year. I'm glad that we are making our own websites for documentation because I'm interested in Web Development as well.

                <h4>RC Plane</h4>
                <p>
                   I'd like to build a lightweight mini-plane that is remote controlled with my phone. I think that I can make the body out of light sticks of wood, which will reduce the horsepower needed for the engine. I would need to learn about the physics of a plane (I haven't taken a physics class yet) and how to recieve signals from my phone. It seems like a challenge, but I'm confident that I can overcome it within 7 weeks.

                <p>
                   One of my hobbies is rowing. I have been erging a lot during quarantine, and a problem that I always have is not being able to change the music while I'm in the middle of a set. My idea is to attach a mini controller on the handle of the erg (obviously putting it in a place that won't affect my rowing), so that I'll be able to skip, pause, or replay my music.
